What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists look for ethical ways to create code that will benefit society or users in some way shape or form. It is important because todays society is orbiting around the use of electronics, and without computer scientists we wouldn't be able to continue having access to this global network of information. We have evolved so much as a people because of our access to electronics, and we only continue to get better because of it.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The first thing I like to do is write down exactly what the issue is. Then, I do some research on that error on some of my favorite resources like stack overflow, my personal textbooks, and also reach out to friends that might have a bit more experience in whatever field it is. I also like to use youtube because it has a lot of informational videos. Then i try to solve that error based on what I learn. If it doesn't work, I either continue doing research on it, ask for more help, or try a different method.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I am responsible for making usre that there is not a way for my code to be damaging to people in any way. I am also responsible for listing out possible ethical concerns to the company or customer who will be receiving the code, and suggesting solutions to them. I should also list out all warnings to the end user as well so that way they know whatever risk there might be.
